      <p>
        Kirkland Calc (&ldquo;the site,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is a free
        calculator tool published by Kirkland Corner. This policy explains what
        information we collect when you use the site, how it&rsquo;s used, and
        the choices you have.
      </p>

      <h2>Information the calculator itself collects</h2>
      <p>
        None. The membership calculator runs entirely in your browser. The
        numbers you enter (monthly spend, gas usage, membership status) are
        never sent to or stored on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We use Matomo, a web analytics service, to understand how visitors use
        the site (pages viewed, referring site, approximate location derived
        from IP address, device and browser type, and links clicked). Matomo
        may set cookies to distinguish visitors and sessions. This data is
        aggregated and used only to improve the site; it is not sold or used
        to identify you personally.
      </p>

      <h2>Newsletter signup</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to subscribe to the Kirkland Corner newsletter through

        any time using the link in any email you receive from them.
